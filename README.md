# Snake Game

This Python script implements the classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics module. Players control a snake that grows in length each time it eats food, with the objective of avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail.

**Key Features:**
* Snake Movement: The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
* Food Consumption: The snake grows longer each time it eats food, and the score increases accordingly.
* Collision Detection: Detects collisions with walls and the snake's own tail, resetting the game upon collision.
* Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score, which resets when the snake collides with a wall or its tail.

**Technologies Used:**
* Python
* Turtle graphics module
